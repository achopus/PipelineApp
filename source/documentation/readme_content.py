## ðŸ“Š Understanding Your Results

### **Behavioral Metrics Explained**

#### **Movement Metrics**
- **Total Distance**: How far the animal traveled during the entire session
- **Average Velocity**: Mean speed of movement (useful for activity levels)
- **Time Moving**: Percentage of time the animal was active vs. stationary
- **Peak Velocity**: Maximum speed reached (indicates burst activity)

#### **Spatial Behavior**
- **Time in Center**: How long the animal spent in the arena center
  - *Higher values* = More exploratory, less anxious behavior
  - *Lower values* = More anxious, wall-hugging behavior
- **Thigmotaxis Ratio**: Preference for arena edges vs. center
  - *Values close to 1* = Strong wall preference (higher anxiety)
  - *Values close to 0* = Center preference (lower anxiety)
- **Distance to Wall**: Average proximity to arena boundaries
  - *Lower values* = Stays close to walls
  - *Higher values* = Ventures toward center

#### **Temporal Patterns**
- **Time-binned Analysis**: Shows how behavior changes over time
  - Early bins: Initial response to novel environment
  - Later bins: Habituation and exploration patterns
- **Activity Over Time**: Movement patterns throughout the session

### **Statistical Results Interpretation**

#### **Understanding P-values**
- **p < 0.05**: Statistically significant difference between groups
- **p â‰¥ 0.05**: No statistically significant difference detected

#### **Effect Sizes (Two-way ANOVA)**
- **RÂ² values** show how much of the behavior variation is explained:
  - **RÂ² = 0.01-0.05**: Small effect
  - **RÂ² = 0.06-0.13**: Medium effect  
  - **RÂ² = 0.14+**: Large effect

#### **Interaction Effects**
- **Significant Interaction**: The effect of one factor depends on the other
  - Example: Drug effect varies by genotype
- **Non-significant Interaction**: Factors act independently
  - Example: Drug and genotype have separate, additive effects

## ðŸŽ¯ Experimental Applications

### **Open Field Test (OFT)**
**Best for measuring:**
- General locomotor activity
- Anxiety-like behavior (center vs. edge preference)
- Exploratory behavior patterns
- Drug effects on movement and anxiety

### **Typical Research Questions**
- Does treatment reduce anxiety-like behavior?
- How does genotype affect locomotor activity?
- Are there sex differences in exploration patterns?
- Does the drug effect change over time?

## ðŸ“ˆ Tips for Best Results

### **Video Quality**
- Ensure good lighting and contrast
- Keep camera position consistent across sessions
- Minimize shadows and reflections in arena

### **Experimental Design**
- Balance group sizes when possible
- Randomize testing order
- Control for time of day effects
- Consider habituation periods

### **Data Interpretation**
- Always consider both statistical and biological significance
- Look for consistent patterns across multiple metrics
- Consider individual variation within groups
- Validate findings with additional experiments

## ï¿½ Customizing Your Analysis

### **Filename Structure**
Design your filename structure to match your experimental factors:
- **Simple**: `Subject_Treatment.mp4`
- **Complex**: `Subject_Treatment_Dose_Day_Arena.mp4`
- Each field becomes a grouping factor for statistics

### **Time Binning**
- Default: 5-minute bins for temporal analysis
- Useful for tracking habituation and adaptation
- Shows early vs. late session differences

### **Arena Configuration**
- Standard: 80cm x 80cm open field
- Center defined as central 40% of arena
- Thigmotaxis zone: outer 20% of arena

## ï¿½ Best Practices

### **Project Organization**
1. Use descriptive project names
2. Maintain consistent filename structures
3. Document experimental conditions
4. Keep backups of raw data

### **Statistical Analysis**
1. Plan your analysis before data collection
2. Consider multiple comparison corrections
3. Report effect sizes alongside p-values
4. Include descriptive statistics in results

### **Result Reporting**
1. Export statistical results for records
2. Save trajectory plots for presentations
3. Document analysis parameters used
4. Include sample sizes in reports

**Remember**: This application provides the tools for analysis, but proper experimental design and interpretation require understanding of your specific research context and behavioral paradigms.'''
